## 🌟 Welcome!

This repository serves as my personal JavaScript playground and a growing collection of code examples, concepts, and challenges. It's designed to be a place where I solidify my understanding of various JavaScript features, patterns, and problem-solving techniques.

I hope these examples will also be a valuable resource for other aspiring and seasoned developers looking to refresh their knowledge or explore specific JS concepts.

## 🎯 What's Inside?

This repository is organized by JavaScript concepts and common problem types. You'll find examples covering:

* **🔍 Basic Syntax & Variables:** `var`, `let`, `const`, data types.
* **✅ Operators & Expressions:** Arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment.
* **⚙️ Control Flow:** `if/else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `for...of`, `for...in`).
* **📦 Functions:** Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, `this` binding, default parameters, rest/spread.
* ** closures:** Deep dives into closures with practical examples.
* **✨ Arrays & Objects:** Common methods, destructuring, iteration.
* **🔄 Asynchronous JavaScript:** Callbacks, Promises, `async/await`.
* **🌐 DOM Manipulation:** (If applicable, for browser-based examples)
* **🛠️ Error Handling:** `try...catch`.
* **📊 Algorithms & Data Structures:** Simple implementations (e.g., sorting, searching, basic linked lists).
* **💡 Design Patterns:** Basic patterns implemented in JS.
* **📈 ES6+ Features:** Modern JavaScript syntax and features.
* **❓ Interview Questions:** Solutions to common JS interview challenges.

Each example is typically a standalone `.js` file, often with comments explaining the logic and expected output.
